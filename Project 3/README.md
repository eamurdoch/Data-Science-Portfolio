IST 718 Big Data Analytics 

Work for this project was divided between general model train/eval and real time image processing.

Code for these two general areas was kept sepearate for division of group labor and individual operating system dependencies

GENERAL MODEL TRAIN/EVAL

Executed in part 1: Image Capture and Label  - which was opted to run on a virtual environment with code running in Jupyter (Filed named: "IST718Project_Model_TrainEval_Part1")

Part 2 of general model train/eval used .tar files generated in the first part and incorporated into a CoLab environment for expedited processing (Filed named: "IST718Project_Model_TrainEval_Part2").

.tar files containing different image sets were seperated saved and labeled: ".tar file for model x" and are applicable if replicating this in CoLab.

File path for the upload of the .tar can be found in the first section of "IST718Project_Model_TrainEval_Part2" code.

If CoLab is not preferred, images and annotation are uploaded in folders, separated into train and test, and annotated by which model they support.

.tar files and folders with all images are avilable within branches at: https://sumailsyr.sharepoint.com/sites/ImagesforIST718ASLProject/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

REAL TIME IMAGE PROCESSING

Code replicates much of the same functionality as the train and eval portion but focused on optimizing parameters for real time detection and classification.

This portion of the code is named "IST718Project_Model_RealTimeCapture"

This code used a variation on the image library test and train and is annotated as such
